# Mushroom Classification
This project aims to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on various attributes using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains descriptions of samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms from the Agaricus and Lepiota family, as drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981).
# Dataset Description : 
	The dataset provides the following attributes for each mushroom sample: 
    1. cap-shape: Shape of the mushroom cap (bell=b, conical=c, convex=x, flat=f, knobbed=k, sunken=s).
    2. cap-surface: Surface texture of the mushroom cap (fibrous=f, grooves=g, scaly=y, smooth=s).
    3. cap-color: Color of the mushroom cap (brown=n, buff=b, cinnamon=c, gray=g, green=r, pink=p, purple=u, red=e, white=w, yellow=y).
    4. bruises: Presence of bruises on the mushroom (bruises=t, no=f).
    5. odor: Odor of the mushroom (almond=a, anise=l, creosote=c, fishy=y, foul=f, musty=m, none=n, pungent=p, spicy=s).
    6. gill-attachment: Attachment type of the gills (attached=a, descending=d, free=f, notched=n).
    7. gill-spacing: Spacing between gills (close=c, crowded=w, distant=d).
    8. gill-size: Size of the gills (broad=b, narrow=n).
    9. gill-color: Color of the gills (black=k, brown=n, buff=b, chocolate=h, gray=g, green=r, orange=o, pink=p, purple=u, red=e, white=w, yellow=y).
    10. stalk-shape: Shape of the mushroom stalk (enlarging=e, tapering=t).
    11. stalk-root: Type of the mushroom stalk root (bulbous=b, club=c, cup=u, equal=e, rhizomorphs=z, rooted=r, missing=?).
    12. stalk-surface-above-ring: Surface texture of the stalk above the ring (fibrous=f, scaly=y, silky=k, smooth=s).
    13. stalk-surface-below-ring: Surface texture of the stalk below the ring (fibrous=f, scaly=y, silky=k, smooth=s).
    14. stalk-color-above-ring: Color of the stalk above the ring (brown=n, buff=b, cinnamon=c, gray=g, orange=o, pink=p, red=e, white=w, yellow=y).
    15. stalk-color-below-ring: Color of the stalk below the ring (brown=n, buff=b, cinnamon=c, gray=g, orange=o, pink=p, red=e, white=w, yellow=y).
    16. veil-type: Type of veil (partial=p, universal=u).  
    17. veil-color: Color of the veil (brown=n, orange=o, white=w, yellow=y).
    18. ring-number: Number of rings (none=n, one=o, two=t).
    19. ring-type: Type of ring (cobwebby=c, evanescent=e, flaring=f, large=l, none=n, pendant=p, sheathing=s, zone=z). 
    20. spore-print-color: Color of the spore print (black=k, brown=n, buff=b, chocolate=h, green=r, orange=o, purple=u, white=w, yellow=y).
    21. population: Population density (abundant=a, clustered=c, numerous=n, scattered=s, several=v, solitary=y).
 	  22. habitat: Habitat of the mushroom (grasses=g, leaves=l, meadows=m, paths=p, urban=u, waste=w, woods=d).
	The target variable is the class, indicating whether the mushroom is edible (e) or poisonous (p).
# Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build a machine-learning model that can accurately classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on their attributes. By leveraging the provided dataset and applying various machine-learning techniques, we aim to develop a robust classification model that can assist in identifying the edibility of mushrooms.
